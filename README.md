# GPS Receiver component of the GPS Spoofing Detection System

This element is responsible for the acquisition of single NMEA phrases. Itâ€™s considered to be one of the elements with lowest computation power, thus the workload is minimal. The operations performed by this component are:

1. Acquire raw GPS signal
2. Get the NMEA phrase from the signal
3. Transmit the phrase to the data producer
